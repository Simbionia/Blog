            <h3>Code Nation</h3>
            <p>I joined the Code Nation coding course after getting recommended by the job centre.
                When they recommended it to me I was intrigued by as I hadn't done any coding before, but I'd always had
                an
                interest in tech beforehand so I figured it was worth a try.
                Also I felt it could really help me when it comes to the job market as knowing coding could give me a
                big step
                up and make me more noticeable to employers. </p>

            <h3>My interests in technology</h3>
            <p>I've been interested in tech since I was a young child playing on a PS1 sitting on the living room floor.
                since that I've only gotten more invested through different PC's and laptops over the years, having
                learnt more
                about the hardware rather than the software though.
                One reason I wanted to start learn more about the software side of things was because of my interest in
                gaming,
                and knowing how the games work on the inside I feel would help me understand and appreciate them more.
                Because of that I feel learning coding will really help me with my understanding of IT, and help
                diversify my
                skill set when it comes to tech, plus it could open up a lot more opportunities. </p>

            <h3>The importance of IT in modern business</h3>
            <p>There are a lot of reasons why IT is important in modern business.Companies rely on IT for fast
                communications
                wether within the company itself, or between the company and consumers. data processing and market
                intelligence
                are also important as they help companies analyse all the data they're getting and use that to improve
                they're
                strategy. IT plays a very important role in pretty much every industry, helping companies improve their
                business
                activities by making everything they do more efficient, thus making them operate at a better pace.
                Achieve lower
                cost overall by only having to set up systems once that then operate over a long period before needing
                to be
                upgraded. Increase the amount of money companies can earn by allowing them to more efficiently tap into
                the
                market and keep an edge over the competition.
            </p>

            <h3>Methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h3>
            <li>Good management can really boost a project's success. Effective management ensures happy workers,
                meaning that
                they'll work harder.</li>
            <li>Making sure there is good communication between the whole team is very important to have it so they are
                all
                gelling well together and everyone is on the same page when it come to the project.</li>
            <li>Having a solid plan of action means that everyone will always know what they're doing, this could be
                achieved by
                using services such as Trello and Slack.</li>
            <li>Knowing what the target audience of the product wants is another good way of making sure that the
                project goes
                well. As knowing that ensures that the project won't go off the rails with its end goal at any point.
            </li>

            <h3>Planning and carrying out tasks using IT</h3>
            <p>The first thing I did when it came to planning this out was to find a way to keep track of everything
                that I was
                doing/going to do.
                To do this I used Trello so that I had everything organised in an easy to use fashion, the board I used
                can be
                seen here: https://trello.com/b/DsxgQFa9/html-blog .
                With that base I started to develop the blog using HTML, making sure that I properly researched how to
                do
                everything that i was setting out to do.
                This made sure that I wasn't getting stuck on things that were easily found online.</p>

            <h3>Risks that could impact digital projects</h3>
            <p>Bad management can cause projects to come to a halt as it may cause friction between the rest of the
                workers and
                the project leads. Or that it becomes extremely inefficient due to project leads not knowing what
                they're doing.
                <br> <br>
                Over the course of a project the original vision of the project may become lost due to decisions made
                and this
                in turn might lead to the result of the product being very muddled and creatively confused.
                <br> <br>
                The initial vision of a product may be far too ambitious for what the team can handle, this could be
                because of bad planning before the project resulting in higher expectations than can be met. Leading to
                delays, or in
                the worst cases cancellation.
                <br> <br>
                If the project is being worked on as part of a larger company, then over the course of the project it
                may result
                in workers/resources being reallocated. Making it so that the project might not reach its full
                potential.</p>
            <h3>Selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
            <p>To figure out what software I wanted to use first I needed to research what was available and there are a
                number
                of things that can help me decide what I want to use including;</p>
            <li>Usability</li>
            <p>When looking at software it's important to check how user friendly it is, you can do this by checking
                what
                different options are in the software such as drag and drop execution which can make things a lot
                easier.
                But when doing this it's also a good idea to check that these features are usable by everyone that
                you're
                working with.</p>
            <li>Security</li>
            <p>How secure a software is is also important to choosing which software that you want to use, if what you
                choose is
                not secure then it could end up disastrously for whoever is using it.
                For example it's possible that all of the work could end up lost due to someone hacking into the system,
                meaning
                that security is a high priority when picking software.</p>
            <li>Functionality</li>
            <p>Functionality can make a big impact when it comes to picking software to use.
                if the functionality that you're looking for isn't in the software, then it could lead to you dropping
                that
                software completely.
                On the other hand however great functionality might mean that you pick that software despite other
                glaring
                issues in it.</p>

            <h3>how the technologies I chose have helped me achieve my goals</h3>
            <li>Trello</li>
            <p>Trello helped me by providing me with a place to keep all my ideas organised.
                And by using it well when I was stuck it really helped keep me on track by giving me a clear idea of
                what to do
                next because I'd clearly set out what I needed to be doing beforehand.</p>
            <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
            <p>Visual Studio Code was vital to making sure I could actually complete the whole thing because without it
                you
                wouldn't even be able to see this web page.
                In VS code I coded the website through HTML as all the UI was very clear and streamlined meaning that it
                was
                very easy to get to grips to.</p>
            <li>GitHub</li>
            <p>With GitHub I had a way to back up my code online, which was useful because it gave me a fallback incase
                something went wrong while I was coding.
                Also it was useful as a way for other people to look over my code to check for errors/inefficient coding
                when I
                requested them to thanks to the functionality of GitHub.</p>

            <h3>Legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h3>
            <p>The legal guidelines that can affect digital projects generally fall under GDPR. GDPR can impact digital
                projects
                in a number of ways.
                <br></br>
                1) The right to access â€“this means that
                consumers have the right to request access to their personal data and to ask how the company uses that
                data
                after it has been obtained. The company has to provide a copy of the data free of charge, and digitally
                if
                requested.
                <br></br>
                2) The right to be forgotten â€“ if consumers are no longer customers, or if they request that a company
                can't use
                their personal data anymore, then they have the right to have their data deleted.
                <br></br>
                3) The right to data portability â€“ consumers have a right to transfer their data from one service to
                another.
                And it has to happen in a format that if frequently used and can be accessed digitally.
                <br></br>
                4) The right to be informed â€“ this covers any gathering of data by companies, and consumers must be
                notified
                before any data is gathered. Consumers have to agree to terms for their data to be gathered, and consent
                must be
                freely given rather than implied.
                <br></br>
                5) The right to have information corrected â€“ this ensures that consumers can have their data updated if
                it is
                out of date or incorrect.
                <br></br>
                6) The right to restrict processing â€“ consumers can request that their data is not used for processing.
                Their
                record can remain in place, but not be used.
                <br></br>
                7) The right to object â€“ this includes the right of consumers to stop the processing of their data for
                direct
                marketing. There are no exemptions to this rule, and any processing must stop as soon as the request has
                been
                received. Also, this right must be made clear to consumers at the beginning of any interactions with the
                company.
                <br></br>
                8) The right to be notified â€“ If there has been a data breach in which an individualâ€™s personal data has
                been
                compromised, the individual has a right to be informed within 72 hours of the company first having
                become aware
                of the breach.</p>

        <div class="outline">
            <h3>The content and layout for each page</h3>
            <p>While all the content is currently on one page I can visualise what the website will look like when it's
                completed.
                The first page would be the information about me, also on that page there would be a drop down menu
                linking to
                other pages on the site.
                On these other pages is where the other topics from this page would be, they would be grouped based upon
                what
                topics they were discussing.
                Such as the copyright and legal guidelines topics as they are quite obviously related, meaning that
                those being
                together would make the most sense.
                Doing this would make my site seem a lot more professional.</p>

            <h3>Copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>
            <p>Copyright protects the interests of writers, artists, musicians and other creative people and all the
                projects
                that they create.
                Copyright affects how businesses decide what to do in a lot of different ways on a regular basis.
                Images and text for business websites, advertisements and newsletters are all subject to copyright law.
                Selecting copyrighted materials for businesses without permission, such as lifting photographs from the
                Internet
                somewhere other than a royalty free site, which states that the images are free for the public to use,
                makes it
                so the business could be subject to a very expensive copyright infringement lawsuit.
                Employment contracts can also be affected by copyright law when businesses put in clauses in contracts
                specifying who owns the copyrights to any creative product produced at the workplace.
                <br><br>
                If using copyrighted material with consent, then the websites may likely have to pay royalty fees as
                well incurring further expenses for them.
                This means that it's a much better idea to use self made or royalty free content from places such as
                ghetty images on your website so as to not rack up a much larger running cost than needed.</p>

            <h3>Issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we overcome them</h3>
            <p>There are many ways that people could struggle when it comes to accessing websites. </p>
            <li>Hard for them to process/look at non-text based content</li>
            <p>People with impaired vision or brain injuries may have problems with viewing images making it so
                images/video may
                appear blurry.
                Because of this it's important to make it so there is text based alternatives or descriptions for this
                content
                to make it so these users can more easily access the website.</p>
            <li>Hard for them to process/look at text based content</li>
            <p>The opposite of the previous problem, people with sight issues may also have trouble looking at text
                based
                content.
                To help these it people out it's a good idea to have ways to increase the size of the text to make it
                easier to
                make out, as well as having images and video options that also display the content from the page.</p>
            <li>Issues with video</li>
            <p>Another problem that could come up is that users who have hearing/sensory issues may have a lot of
                trouble with
                any video content on websites.
                For this it's a good idea to have captions or a description of what is in the video so that these users
                can use
                the sites with minimal problems.</p>
            <li>Struggles with using computer hardware</li>
            <p>Users may not use a mouse when interacting with the internet, so this means that it's important to make
                it so
                websites can be fully used with only a keyboard.
                Also some others may use voice input to interact with websites so having it so your websites can
                interface with
                these functions too is also important.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
            <p>There are a lot of different file types that are used in websites, some of the more popular ones include;
            </p>
            <li>.HTML</li>
            <li>.JPEG</li>
            <li>.AVI</li>
            <li>.CSS</li>
            <li>.EXE</li>
            <li>.PDF</li>
            <li>.MP3</li>
            <li>.DOC</li>
            <li>.GIF</li>
            <p>These are more popular due to the fact that they are all fairly easy to use, do not have any massive
                barriers to entry and they are generally considered to be among the best at what each of them do.</p>

            <h3>Was I happy with the tools I used?</h3>
            <p>I would say that I'm happy with each of the tools I used for different reasons. I was happy with Trello
                for being a very useful way to easily organise and set out all the tasks I needed to do. I was happy
                with Visual Studio Code for being very easy to get to grips with and the vast range of options it gave
                me.
                And I was happy with Github for giving me a way to back up and store all the work I had done.</p>
            <h3>Were the tools I used appropriate?</h3>

            <h3>Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the project</h3>
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <li>I would consider the overall design of the website a strength, I like the fact that I kept it simple so
                as to not overwhelm anyone who would be looking at it. I'm also happy with the contrasting colour scheme
                I have with the blue and orange as this really helps it look less like one very long wall of text.</li>
            <li>The simplicity of the website I also feel is a strength, as whenI look at a lot of websites I find that
                with a fair few of them that the sheer amount of different things you see when first loading them up can
                be a bit overwhelming. And this gives me a bad first impression of the website and so I feel it's better
                to keep it simple.</li>
            <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
            <li>What I would consider the main weakness of the website is my own writing ability. I've always struggled
                with describing things that require my personal opinion to be explained rather than just stating it or
                regurgitating facts and this has
                been no different. As you can see from the rest of the website a lot of the sections may seem like they
                need a lot more description, but it's been the best I can do without just copy pasting paragraphs from
                across the web.</li>
            <li>All of the content being on one page makes it look pretty unprofessional and it would really benefit
                from having the content split up rather than as a large wall of text.</li>
            <p>Overall I'm fairly happy with how the website turned out, but there is a lot of room for improvement with
                the website If I did further work on it.</p>
            <h3>Further improvements I can make to my project</h3>
            <p>The first improvement I can think of for my website is that is could separate the different sections onto
                different pages, it would be helpful to do this just for the sake of making it all easier to read rather
                than having it all as one big wall of text.

                Another improvement I could make is to refine how the website looks, at the moment it all looks kind of
                blocky and it wouldn't be out of place in the 90's. I'd improve this by looking up techniques such as a
                way to make the colours blend together better, how to add better borders and a more attractive looking
                font among things.</p>
            <h3>"Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose"</h3>
            <p>I've done everything that I was assigned to do and have hopefully done it well.</p>
            <h3>Could I have been more efficient while designing?</h3>
            <p>I definitely could've been more efficient while designing the website. One of the ways that I could've
                improved my efficiency is that I was overcomplicating the work I was doing at times. I was doing things
                like making multiple classes for the same task on a different part of the page where I could make do
                with just one. Working in a team would've been another way for me to be more efficient, it may have
                helped me by allowing each member of the team to focus on different parts of the website. For example
                I'm better with the visual design and coming up with ideas for the site, whereas I struggle with the
                written side of things and in a team someone else could've taken that burden on.</p>
            <h3>Ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
            <li>Prioritise what you have to do</li>
            <p>When it comes to work make sure that you have the tasks that you need to do in the right order.
                By doing this you can make it so that the more important tasks that you have to do are the ones that are
                getting done first and that may help further down the line.</p>
            <li>Improve your knowledge of your equipment</li>
            <p>Knowing all the capabilities of the equipment that you're using can save a lot of time in the long run,
                this could be things such as knowing all the keyboard shortcuts that a programme uses which may speed
                things up considerably.</p>
            <li>If needed, make sure to ask for help</li>
            <p>When you're stuck it may seem like a point of pride to try and force yourself through without asking for
                help, this is could be a big problem though as who knows how long you could be stuck. It's a much
                simpler, and better, idea to just ask for help if it's going to seriously impact your work.</p>
            <li>Take regular breaks</li>
            <p>Working for an extended period of time on something thats important/nearly finished may seem tempting,
                but if you keep working for longer and longer your productivity will take a serious hit as your mind
                gets more fatigued. To stop this from happening take a 5 minute break every hour or so to refresh your
                mind and body.</p>
            <h3>What I would do differently if I did this again</h3>
            <p>If I go about designing a website again the first thing I would do is t find myself a team to work with.
                I think this is the most important thing to me as I feel that on my own the flaws that show are so much
                that it greatly brings the rest of my work, While if I'm working in a team those flaws can be lessened
                or hidden by others who are more competent in those sections. Something else I would do differently is
                to make sure that I don't overcomplicate things for myself as this has lead to problems in this project
                where I have gotten myself stuck thinking that something is more complicated and not knowing what to do.
            </p>
            <h3>Testing Digital Solutions</h3>
            <p>When testing digital solutions it's important to start testing early and often, this is because in the
                long run it will save you a lot of time as if something get caught early it can be as lot easier to
                change it as opposed to when it's more developed. Something that is also important when testing is to
                make sure that everything is set out and explained clearly during the testing process, this is because
                if everything is not clear to those doing the testing then you may end up getting useless feedback which
                just ends up meaning that the testing was a waste of time.</p>
